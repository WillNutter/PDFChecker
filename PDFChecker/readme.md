This repository is a set of python scripts I wrote to check all existing PDFs for any malicious attachments inside them.
The PDFcheck.py is the baseline as it outputs every file checked. Note - no files are changed or deleted.
The suspicous.py file only shows files that failed the check and have malicious attachments.
